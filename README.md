# HR Management System Solution
## Background
Jaya Jaya Maju is a multinational company that has been established since the year 2000. It has more than 1,000 employees spread across the country.

Although it has grown into a fairly large company, Jaya Jaya Maju still struggles with managing its employees. This has resulted in a high attrition rate (the ratio of employees leaving to the total number of employees) of over 10%.

To prevent this issue from worsening, the HR department manager would like to try a solution that could help identifying the various factors that contribute to the high attrition rate.
